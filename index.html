            <p>My full name is Justin Patrick Durocher and I am currently enrolled in the UConn Coding Bootcamp hosted in Downtown Hartford, CT. I am twenty years old, orginally from New Hampshire but currently live eright outside the city in Newington, CT. I work as a valet captain in the city and am hoping to find a better job after the program.</p>
            <p>I first got into code about a year ago when my friend showed me the basic ins and outs of html and css. It grasped my attention and interests me a lot. I am very motived to see how far my learning will be able to take me. I enjoy learning on my own at my own pace, unlike the two other universities I have attended. I first went to school for sport management then changed to buisness but I didn't feel like I was in the right spot.</p>
            <p>I have graduated from Newington High School in 2017 with a big sports scholarship to play lacrosse or soccer at Springfield College. I decided to go with my favorite sport lacrosse. I had only two months of that until I was forced to leave the campus for partying and too many write ups. I threw away my collegiete career just to be stupid. This is why I am here today. I am here to prove that I do belong in this very difficult field. After the two months, I transferred to a local community college in Manchester, CT for buisness. Was not too interested in that, found more interest in coding and web development.</p>
